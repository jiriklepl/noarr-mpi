# NOTES

## KaMPIng

- KaMPIng does not support non-contiguous non-range data types.
  - e.g., sub-matrices

## MPL

- MPL supports sub-arrays (even multi-dimensional ones) and non-contiguous data types.
- However, work with the library is tedious.
- Doesn't natively support distributing into different layouts.

## Boost MPI

- This should work in theory.
- [ ] TODO
